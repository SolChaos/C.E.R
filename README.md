Precision can be a factor in a program as if you fail to check if you have evrything you need, the program could fail.
And if you miss or skip certain steps in a program it could either, break, glitch out, alter, or flat out not work.
If you develops these skills in programming/coding, it would allow you to basically do it on a whim, similar to muscle memory.
So in my opinion, skipping steps and not getting used to programming/coding could be a big obstacle for you to overcome and a major hassle as well.
